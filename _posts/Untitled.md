In this post, I will share how I build my personal website (and how you can build yours!):

The most important tools are:

- Hosting: GitHub Page
- Blogging: Jekyll
- Subscribing: Mailchimp
- Commenting: ~~Staticman~~ Discuq

### Hosting

I choose [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) to host my website for the following reason:

- It is free.
- The process is quick and simple.
- It allows me to 100% customize my website design.
- The default domain name *github.io* is recognizable.

With GitHub Page, you can upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files onto a GitHub repository, and boom, your website is published.

Each GitHub account is entitled to one website, with the domain name *username.github.io*, and you can also change the domain name to any domain that you own.

I started my website with an HTML and a CSS file as the front page. (You can learn more about HTML and CSS [here](https://www.w3schools.com/).) 

It works perfectly well as an online resume, or a page to showcase yourself. You can stop here if that's your goal.

But I want to write blogs, recording and sharin my thoughts and learnings with the public. Blogs can also help attract traffic to my website. So I go on and find a blogging solution.

### Blogging

GitHub Page recommends [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator without any use of databases. 

Your website files get organized in a structured way, while creating posts is just as simple as writing a Word/Markdown document.

Jekyll also supports multiple plugins like SEO tagging, RSS feed, etc. See popular plugins [here](https://planetjekyll.github.io/plugins/top).
