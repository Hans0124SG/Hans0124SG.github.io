In this post, I will share how I build my personal website (and how you can build yours!):

The most important tools are:

- Hosting: GitHub Page
- Blogging: Jekyll
- Subscribing: Mailchimp
- Commenting: Discuq
- Indexing with Google

This post serves more as a roadmap, instead of a step-by-step tutorial for your reference. The official websites of the tools I used give pretty clear and most up-to-date tutorials.

### Hosting

I choose [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) to host my website for the following reasons:

- It is free.
- The process is quick and simple.
- It allows me to 100% customize my website design.
- The default domain name *github.io* is recognizable.

With GitHub Page, you can upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files onto a GitHub repository, and boom, your website is published.

Each GitHub account is entitled to one website, with the domain name *username.github.io*, and you can also change the domain name to any domain that you own.

I started my website with an HTML and a CSS file as the front page. (You can learn more about HTML and CSS [here](https://www.w3schools.com/) if you haven't.) It works perfectly well as an online resume, or a page to showcase yourself. 

You can stop here if that's enough for you.

But besides that, I also want to write blogs, recording and sharing my thoughts and learnings with the public. Blogs can also help attract traffic to my website. So let's add a blogging function to our website.

### Blogging

GitHub Page recommends [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator without any use of databases. 

Your website files get organized in a structured way, while creating posts is just as simple as writing a Word/Markdown document with the help of [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates.

Jekyll also supports multiple plugins like SEO tagging, RSS feed, etc. See popular plugins [here](https://planetjekyll.github.io/plugins/top).

### Subscribing

People hardly go to your website periodically to check your new blogs. To notify them when you write a new blog, use a subscribing service like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

Register an account, copy a block of code and paste into your Liquid template, done.

When you want to notify your subscribers about your new posts, you can create a campaign in Mailchimp and customize the email message.

### Commenting

I would like to know how my audience think about my articles. They can leave some comments, and I can reply to their comments.

[Discuq](https://disqus.com/) with its a free tier plan fulfills everything I want.

To install, again embed a block of code into your Liquid template, and it is done. You can control all the comments right in the page as well as in your Discuq dashboard.

### Indexing with Google

To allow others find your website through Google search, you need to index your website.

1. You can use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to submit your website's url, or

2. [Submit your sitemap.xml](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668#addsitemap) (which can be generated by the plugin [*jekyll-sitemap*](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap))

If you want to also see the traffic of your website, you can use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).

That's it. You can build your personal website with so much functionalities for completely free. 

Thanks Internet and the open-source community.
