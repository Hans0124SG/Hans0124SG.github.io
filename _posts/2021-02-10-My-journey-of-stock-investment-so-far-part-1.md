On the night before the Chinese New Year eve, I would like to look back and do a summary on my journey of stock investment. This is to remind myself of the rights and wrongs along the journey, and to share with my audience some tips in investment.

I would like to divide my journey into 4 periods:

- The luck (Nov 19 ~ Feb 20) :  I made some lucky money on stocks without much logic
- The crush (Mar 20 ~ Apr 20): Market crushed and I was scared and let go of my stocks
- The misbelief (May 20 ~ Oct 20): Over-confident in a small cap stock that ruined all my gains
- The learning (Nov 20 ~ now): Learning basic valuation and build up my investment logic

### The luck

When I just started investing, I was a complete newbie. I bought stocks based on trends, based on news, based on my own beliefs, based on anything but valuation of the company.

Luckily, some of the companies I bought (e.g. 2400.HK, BILI and CRM) performed well and gave me the initial confidence in continuing stock investing. However, one bomb was planted in my porfolio and exploded later.

2400.HK: I bought it when it was just listed in HK market. I knew TapTap as a platform some time ago, but I didn't play any of their games before. I liked the gaming industry and believed the CEO was just and capable. The stock price started to rise immediately, and after it peaked and dipped, I sold it with around 100% of profit. If I didn't sell it, it would make me more than 500% instead today. In the next few months, I bought it back a few times, but sold it based on price trend again. 

- I would never be able to "eat most part of the fish" if I don't understand the value of the company.

- The buy logic and sell logic was completely different, and I hope I don't make the same mistake again. 

1458.HK: I heard their product so many times but I was not able to try it myself once. I already forgot why I bought it, probably hearing the news that they are opening up the franchise and authorizing to local agents. Once I bought it, the stock price starts to decrease and I saw so many articles talking about how JueWei and HuangShangHuang is beating its ass off. I sold it after it hit my stop loss around 15%. The stock price is almost double after 1 year now.

- It requires understanding of a company to hold it when the price goes down. I used to have stop loss with a stock that I didn't buy based on trend. It just meant when I bought the stock, I was betting it will rocket before it dropped 15%.

At the end of this period, I didn't realize the problem in my investment yet. I was quite happy with myself, and started to buy stocks over margins. I also have no sense of risk management. And these all led to the first crisis in my investment journey.
